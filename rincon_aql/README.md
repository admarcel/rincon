The [rincon_aql] [crate] aims to easily build [AQL] queries in a typesafe way. Composing queries in a
typesafe manner has some great advantages:

* The compiler checks for correct syntax of [AQL] queries.
* The autocompletion feature of an editor or IDE gives aid on the [AQL] syntax.
* Refactoring of document fields are applied to [AQL] queries as well.

The [rincon_aql] [crate] is part of the [Rincon ArangoDB Rust driver project][Rincon project].

**Status: Experimental**

**This crate is mainly an idea that is planned to be implemented after other crates of the [Rincon]
project have reached a major milestone.**
