The [rincon_session_async] [crate] provides a convenient API for __asynchronous__ communication with an
[ArangoDB] server.

The [rincon_session_async API] is a higher level API on top of the [rincon_client API] and provides
additional features:

* Convenient API for applications to communicate to an [ArangoDB] server. (PLANNED)
<br/>E.g. no need to manually specify the database and collection on each and every request.
* Efficient handling of connections to the [ArangoDB] server (PLANNED)
* Efficient execution of batch operations (PLANNED)
* Convenient API for transaction handling (PLANNED)

The [rincon_session_async] [crate] is part of the [Rincon ArangoDB Rust driver project][Rincon project].

__Note__: A similar but synchronous API is provided by the [rincon_session] crate which is
also part of the [Rincon] project.   

## Usage

To use the asynchronous session API of this crate add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rincon_core = "0.1"
rincon_connection = "0.1"
rincon_session_async = "0.1"
```

And this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate rincon_core;
extern crate rincon_connection;
extern crate rincon_session_async;
```

__Important__: As [rincon_session_async] depends on [rincon_client] it re-exports the crate features
of [rincon_client]. Therefore please make sure that you specify the features for
[rincon_session_async] that are suitable for the setup of your [ArangoDB] server the same way as 
specified for the [rincon_client] crate.
