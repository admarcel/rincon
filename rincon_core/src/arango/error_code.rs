//! Error codes and their meanings
//!
//! This module defines the `ErrorCode` enum for all possible error codes as
//! listed in the official documentation of *ArangoDB*.
//!
//! Source: [https://docs.arangodb.com/devel/Manual/Appendix/ErrorCodes.html](https://docs.arangodb.com/devel/Manual/Appendix/ErrorCodes.html)
//!
//! The `ErrorCode` enum is defined by means of the macro `error_code_enum`.
//! This macro defines the enum variants as well as the functions `from_u16`
//! and `description`. The function `from_u16` can be used to convert an u16
//! value into the corresponding enum variant. The function `description`
//! returns a `&str` that contains a short description of an error code.
//!

/// it implements the `description` function that returns a short description
